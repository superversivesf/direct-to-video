# AGENTS.md — Direct to Video

> **Status snapshot:** 2026-07-19. v2.1.4. All 263 tests pass (173 server + 90 client), build and typecheck clean, E2E suite (13 tests) verified, lint clean. Redesigned in v2.0 (note giver replaces executive; automatic voting) and v2.1 (ready indicators, host kick, stale-disconnect cleanup). v2.1.2 adds ESLint+Prettier, force-start, spectator mode. v2.1.3 adds franchise card enhancement (UI for picking previously pitched movies). v2.1.4 adds mid-game join as spectator (new players joining mid-game spectate the current round, play from next round). Security-hardened for public internet exposure.

## Project Overview

Direct to Video is a self-hosted web app for playing a remote party game. It is an unofficial clone of [Pitch Storm](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254132/pitchstorm) by Cutlass & Cape Games — all credit for the game design and card content goes to them. Players join via a 4-letter room code, manage cards in a private browser view, and pitch verbally over Zoom/Teams. A separate audience page displays the full game state for screen-sharing.

**Repository:** `https://github.com/superversivesf/direct-to-video` — git repo on `master` branch.
**Production:** `https://dtv.superversive.net` (behind nginx HTTPS proxy).

## Build & Run Commands

### Development

```bash
npm install                  # Install all workspace dependencies
npm run dev:server           # tsx watch server/src/index.ts — server on :3000
npm run dev:client           # Vite dev server on :5173 (proxies WS to :3000)
```

Use `http://localhost:5173` for development.

### Build

```bash
npm run build                # Builds client (vite) + compiles server (tsc)
npm run build:client         # Builds client only
```

Build output: `client/dist/` (static files) + `server/dist/` (compiled JS).

### Test

```bash
npm test                     # Runs both server + client test suites from root
cd server && npx vitest run  # 173 server tests
cd client && npx vitest run  # 90 client tests

# E2E (requires build first + running server on :3100):
npm run build
npx playwright test --config e2e/playwright.config.ts

# Stress test (requires running server):
npm run stress:local         # 10 players, 3 rounds, localhost
npm run stress:heavy         # 20 players, 5 rounds, localhost
npm run stress:voting        # 10 players + 30 audience, 3 rounds
npm run stress:extreme       # 20 players + 40 audience, 5 rounds
npm run stress:multiroom     # 4 rooms, 5 players + 10 audience each
STRESS_TARGET=https://dtv.superversive.net STRESS_PLAYERS=20 STRESS_ROUNDS=20 npx tsx stress/stress-test.ts
```

### Typecheck

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit -p server/tsconfig.json   # Server typecheck
npx tsc --noEmit -p client/tsconfig.json   # Client typecheck
```

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build    # App at http://localhost:3000
```

### Lint

**ESLint 9 flat config** in `eslint.config.mjs` with typescript-eslint + react + react-hooks + react-refresh + prettier plugins. Prettier config in `.prettierrc.json` with `.prettierignore`.

```bash
npm run lint           # Run ESLint (exits 0 with 4 intentional react-hooks warnings)
npm run lint:fix       # ESLint --fix
npm run format         # Prettier --write across all source
npm run format:check   # Prettier --check
```

## Architecture

### Monorepo Monolith

Single Node.js process serves:

1. Express REST API (static file serving + SPA fallback) with helmet security headers + rate limiting
2. Socket.IO real-time game state with per-IP connection limits + per-socket event rate limiting
3. Built React static files from `client/dist/`

Socket.IO rooms map to game rooms: players join `room:CODE`, spectators join `audience:CODE`.

### Data Flow

```

### State Management

- **Server:** `RoomStore` class caches rooms in a `Map<string, Room>` and persists to SQLite on every mutation via `dbHandle.saveRoom()`.
- **Client:** `useRoom()` hook subscribes to Socket.IO events and maintains `PublicRoomState` in React `useState`. No Redux/Zustand — pure socket-driven state.
- **Timer:** Server-authoritative. A 1-second `setInterval` loop in `sockets/handlers.ts` ticks all running timers, emits `timer_tick`, and handles expiry. Clients only display the server-pushed values.
- **Timer predicates:** `shared/timer-helpers.ts` exports `timerRunning`, `timerIdle`, `timerPaused`, `timerExpired` — shared by server and client to avoid drift.

### Game State Machine

```
lobby → setup → card-selection → pitching → round-end (auto-vote) → setup (next round) → ... → game-end
                                                                                              │
                                                                                       playAgain → lobby
```

- **lobby:** Players join, host selects total rounds (3/5/7/10, default 5) and optionally toggles franchise cards, host clicks "Start Game". Shareable room link available. Host can kick non-host players via ✕ button.
- **setup:** A **note giver** is assigned from `noteGiverOrder` (random permutation of player IDs, no repeats until everyone has been note giver once). 3 NOTE cards drawn for the note giver. Writers choose deck type (PLOT or CHARACTER) and draw 3 cards. The note giver sees ✓ ready / "choosing..." indicators next to each writer.
- **card-selection:** Writers select 1 card from hand, blind card auto-drawn from opposite deck, click "Ready to Pitch". Phase auto-advances when all writers ready.
- **pitching:** Writers pitch one at a time. Pitch order places the note giver last (they are also a writer); franchise card holders go last otherwise. 45s timer. Note giver can pause to play NOTE cards (5s read window, auto-resumes).
- **round-end:** No manual winner selection. A 15-second voting timer starts automatically when all pitches are done. Every player + audience member votes (one vote each, 1x weight; players cannot vote for themselves). `tallyAndAdvance` computes the round winner from `Room.votes` and adds vote counts to each player's cumulative `score`.
- **game-end:** After the host-selected `totalRounds` is reached. Highest cumulative vote total wins. Ties displayed as ties. "Play Again" resets to lobby (note giver order re-permuted).

### Note Giver Rotation

- `Room.noteGiverOrder` is a random permutation of player IDs, generated at game start.
- `Room.noteGiverIndex` advances each round.
- Once every player has been note giver once, the order is re-permuted (so in games where `totalRounds` > player count, a player may be note giver twice, but never twice in a row within a single permutation).
- The note giver is also a writer — they draw and pitch a card like everyone else, but are sorted to the end of `pitchOrder`.

### Voting

- Triggered automatically by `tallyAndAdvance` path: when the last pitcher ends, the server starts a 15-second voting phase (`voting_started` event with secondsRemaining).
- All players + audience members may vote once. Players cannot vote for themselves (enforced server-side).
- All votes are 1x weight — no 2x executive vote (the executive role no longer exists).
- `vote_update` events stream running tallies to clients during voting.
- When the timer expires (or all eligible voters have voted), `tallyAndAdvance` finalizes the round: it computes `roundWinnerId` (highest vote count; `null` on a tie), adds each player's vote count to their cumulative `score`, and emits `voting_ended` with `roundWinnerId`.
- Cumulative scores persist across rounds; the final winner is the player with the highest total at `game-end`.

### Card Deck Reshuffling

When any deck (plot, character, or note) runs out, it automatically refills and reshuffles from the full card set via `card-ops.ts:getRefillDeck`. This allows games with more players than the physical game was designed for. In 2-player games, franchise cards are filtered from both the initial deck and the refill deck. Franchise cards can also be disabled by the host in the lobby via `set_franchise_enabled`.

### Socket.IO Events

**Client → Server:** `join_room`, `join_audience`, `start_game`, `set_franchise_enabled`, `set_total_rounds`, `kick_player`, `force_start`, `select_franchise_source`, `select_deck_type`, `select_card`, `reveal_movie`, `start_timer`, `pause_timer`, `play_note`, `end_pitch`, `cast_vote`, `play_again`

**Server → Client:** `room_joined` (full per-player state), `player_list_updated`, `movie_revealed`, `timer_started`, `timer_tick`, `timer_paused`, `timer_expired`, `note_played`, `pitch_ended`, `next_pitcher`, `round_started`, `game_ended`, `error`, `audience_joined`, `audience_update`, `voting_started`, `vote_update`, `voting_ended` (sends `roundWinnerId: string | null`), `kicked`

**Removed in v2.0:** `select_winner`, `start_voting`, `end_voting` (client→server) and `winner_selected` (server→client). Voting is now automatic.

### Visibility Rules

- Player hands: only own hand visible to that player
- Note giver NOTE cards: only visible to the note giver (`PublicRoomState.myNoteGiverNotes`)
- Revealed movies, timer, scores, votes, notes played: visible to all players + audience
- Audience never sees private hands

### Special Card Mechanics

- **Auto-draw cards:** Cards with `draws: [{ deck, count }]` and `____` in text automatically draw from the specified deck and substitute the placeholder. E.g., `"has a steamy affair with ____"` draws a character card. Substitution lives in `card-ops.ts:substituteDraws`.
- **Franchise cards:** Cards with `isFranchise: true` and `header: "FRANCHISE PITCH:"` reference previously pitched movies (display-only, handled verbally). Filtered out in 2-player games, and when the host disables franchise cards. Franchise card holders pitch last.
- **Multi-line notes:** Note cards with `/` separator display as separate paragraphs (note + note-giver commentary).
- **Note card draws:** Some note cards draw plot, character, or even other note cards when played.
- **Card rendering:** Note cards use "Permanent Marker" handwritten font. Character cards have red location header above typewriter-font text. Note cards are 20% larger than other cards.

> Note: Server tests now pass cleanly with zero post-test errors. Earlier versions emitted 56 unhandled timer errors from stale-disconnect `setTimeout` callbacks and the 1-second timer `setInterval` firing against closed in-memory SQLite handles — fixed in v2.1.2 by exporting `clearStaleDisconnectTimers()` and `clearTimerInterval()` from `sockets/handlers.ts` and invoking them in `afterEach`.

### Build & Typecheck

- `npm run build` — succeeds (client vite build + server tsc compile)
- `npx tsc --noEmit -p server/tsconfig.json` — clean
- `npx tsc --noEmit -p client/tsconfig.json` — clean

### Features Working

- Full game flow: lobby → setup → card-selection → pitching → round-end (auto-voting) → game-end → play again
- 493 real cards transcribed from the physical game (166 plot, 161 character, 166 note)
- Card deck reshuffling when decks run out (supports large player counts) via `card-ops.ts`
- Room creation with 4-letter codes (no ambiguous chars: no O, 0, I, 1)
- Player join with name persistence via cookie
- Same-name rejoin restores player identity (case-insensitive match)
- Shareable room link with copy button in lobby
- Join page pre-fills room code from `?code=` query parameter
- Leave game button in all phases (marks disconnected, can rejoin later)
- Host succession: if host leaves, first connected player promoted to host
- Host kick: host can remove non-host players from the lobby via ✕ button (`kick_player` → `kicked` event)
- Force-start: host can click "Force Start (skip unprepared writers)" during setup/card-selection when writers are unprepared; server auto-picks plot deck + first card for unprepared writers (including the note giver)
- Note giver role: randomly selected each round from `noteGiverOrder` permutation, rotates with no repeats until everyone has been note giver; note giver also pitches (sorted last)
- Ready indicators: during setup the note giver sees ✓ ready / "choosing..." next to each writer
- Audience/spectator view for screen-sharing
- Automatic voting: 15-second timer starts when all pitches done; all players + audience vote; players can't vote for themselves; all votes 1x weight
- Cumulative scoring: vote counts accumulate across rounds; highest total at game-end wins; ties shown as ties
- Fixed round count: host selects 3/5/7/10 rounds in lobby (default 5)
- Server-authoritative 45-second pitch timer + 15-second voting timer, both with SVG ring display
- Note giver NOTE card play with 5-second pause window and auto-resume
- Auto-draw cards with `____` placeholder substitution (`card-ops.ts:substituteDraws`)
- Franchise card display (filtered in 2-player games; host can disable via `set_franchise_enabled`; holders pitch last)
- Franchise card enhancement: players holding a franchise card pick a previously pitched movie via UI during card-selection; referenced movie displayed alongside the franchise pitch on reveal; franchise source auto-picked on force-start
- Blind card auto-draw from opposite deck on card selection
- Pitch order: note giver sorted last; franchise holders last; otherwise circular from note giver's left
- Stale-disconnect handling: 60s after disconnect, player is fully removed; note giver reassigned if needed; host promoted if needed
- Spectator mode: if a player reconnects during pitching after their slot passed, they're marked `isSpectator`, removed from pitchOrder/movies, but can still vote; flag clears at next round
- Mid-game join as spectator: new players joining mid-game (phase !== lobby) are marked `isSpectator` for the current round; they can vote but don't pitch; flag clears at the start of the next round (`setupRound`), making them full players
- Stale room cleanup (1-hour TTL after all disconnected or game-end)
- SQLite persistence (survives restarts)
- Docker deployment with non-root user, read-only fs, resource limits
- Logging to `data/directtovideo.log` and `data/games.log`
- Rules page at `/rules` with clone acknowledgment
- Confetti animation on game end
- Phase indicator progress dots
- Note cards: Permanent Marker handwritten font, paragraph breaks on `/`
- Character cards: red location header, typewriter-font text
- Favicon (clapperboard SVG)
- Version tag in bottom-right corner

## Known Issues & What Doesn't Work

### 1. No linter or formatter (RESOLVED)

Previously no ESLint, Prettier, or lint configuration existed. Added in v2.1.2: ESLint 9 flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) with typescript-eslint + react + react-hooks + react-refresh + prettier plugins, Prettier config (`.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`), and `lint` / `lint:fix` / `format` / `format:check` scripts in root `package.json`. Existing code was reformatted via `npm run format` and unused-vars were fixed. `npm run lint` exits 0 with 4 intentional `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings in `Audience.tsx` / `Game.tsx` (deliberate partial dependency arrays for effect timing).

### 2. E2E test not verified (RESOLVED)

Previously the Playwright E2E suite (`e2e/full-game.test.ts` + 12 journey specs) was not verified. Verified in v2.1.2: all 13 E2E tests pass in ~8 minutes (full-game + audience-voting × 2 + auto-draw + deck-reshuffle + four-player-softlock + franchise-cards + full-three-player + host-succession × 2 + note-card-timer + reconnection + timer-expiry). Run with `npm run build && npx playwright test --config e2e/playwright.config.ts`.

### 3. Stale-disconnect post-test timer errors (RESOLVED)

Previously `cd server && npx vitest run` emitted 56 unhandled errors after tests passed — stale-disconnect `setTimeout` callbacks and the 1-second timer `setInterval` firing against closed in-memory SQLite handles. Fixed in v2.1.2 by exporting `clearStaleDisconnectTimers()` and `clearTimerInterval()` from `sockets/handlers.ts` and invoking them in `afterEach`. Server tests now pass cleanly with zero post-test errors.

### 4. Force-start for slow writers not implemented (RESOLVED)

Previously no force-start mechanism existed. Added in v2.1.2: host can click "Force Start (skip unprepared writers)" during `setup` or `card-selection` phases when at least one writer is unprepared. Server auto-picks plot deck + first card for unprepared writers (including the note giver), then advances to pitching. Implemented as `forceStart` in `state-machine.ts`, `force_start` socket event handler in `sockets/handlers.ts`, and a host-only button in `Game.tsx`. Disconnected players are skipped (no movie assigned).

### 5. React Router v7 future flag warnings (RESOLVED)

Previously client tests emitted warnings about React Router v6 future flags. Fixed in v2.1.2 by passing `future={{ v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true }}` to `BrowserRouter` in `main.tsx` and `MemoryRouter` in `Join.test.tsx` / `Game.test.tsx`. Client tests now run warning-free.

### 6. No reconnection state recovery (RESOLVED)

Previously if a player disconnected mid-game and reconnected within 60s, they got the current room state with no special handling for missed pitches. Added in v2.1.2: spectator mode for missed pitches. When a player reconnects during the pitching phase and their pitch slot has already passed (`pitchIndex < currentPitchIndex`), they are marked `isSpectator: true`, removed from `pitchOrder` and `movies`, but can still vote in the round they missed. The flag clears automatically at the start of the next round (`setupRound`) and on `playAgain`. The `Player.isSpectator` field is exposed in `PublicPlayer`; `PlayerList` shows a "(spectating)" badge.

## Policy: No GitHub Actions / CI pipelines

This project deliberately does **not** use GitHub Actions or any CI/CD pipeline, and never will. Tests and build are verified manually before release. Do not add `.github/workflows/`, CI configuration files, or any related tooling. This is a final decision, not a gap to be closed.

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default                 | Description                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `PORT`               | `3000`                  | Server listen port          |
| `DB_PATH`            | `data/directtovideo.db` | SQLite database path        |
| `MAX_PLAYERS`        | `20`                    | Max players per room        |
| `MAX_ROOMS`          | `20`                    | Max concurrent active rooms |

Note: `ROOM_TTL_MS`, `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS`, and `STALE_DISCONNECT_MS` (60s) are hardcoded constants in `server/src/index.ts` and `server/src/sockets/handlers.ts`.

## Testing Notes

- **Server tests** use in-memory SQLite (`:memory:`) — no file cleanup needed
- **Client tests** use jsdom + @testing-library/react + jest-dom matchers
- **Socket tests** cover handler setup, kick, stale-disconnect, and the automatic voting flow
- **E2E test** uses raw socket.io-client connections for player actions + a Playwright browser page for the audience UI. Port 3100. Requires `npm run build` + running server first.
- **Stress test** simulates a full N-player game via socket connections. Configurable via `STRESS_TARGET`, `STRESS_PLAYERS`, `STRESS_AUDIENCE`, `STRESS_ROUNDS` env vars. Multi-room variant via `stress/multi-room-stress.ts`.
- State-machine tests cover `startGame`, `setupRound`, `selectDeckType`, `selectCard`, `startPitching`, `revealMovie`, `endPitch`, `tallyAndAdvance`, `nextRound`, `playAgain`, and auto-draw mechanics.

## Future Scope (From README)

- **Team mode** (5-12 players): Teams of 2, 60-second pitches, dual note givers
- **Writers' Room variant**: TV show seasons, winner becomes next note giver, canon building, "6 Seasons and a Movie"

## Gotchas for Agents

1. **Root `npm test` works** — it runs both server and client test suites. You can also run them individually from each workspace.
2. **Server imports use `.js` extensions** — ESM requires this even for TypeScript files. Don't remove them. This includes imports into `sockets/` submodules.
3. **`sockets.ts` is now `sockets/`** — the old single file was split into `sockets/rate-limits.ts`, `sockets/state-mapper.ts`, `sockets/handlers.ts`. Update imports accordingly.
4. **`seed-cards.ts` is huge** — 493 cards, ~600 lines. Don't read the whole file unless necessary. Use grep/search for specific cards.
5. **State machine is pure** — `state-machine.ts` functions take a `RoomStore` and `Room`, mutate via `store.saveRoom()`, and the caller re-fetches with `store.getRoom()`. Always re-fetch after calling a state-machine function.
6. **`tallyAndAdvance` replaces `selectWinner`/`endVoting`/`tallyVotes`** — there is no manual winner selection. Voting starts automatically after the last pitch and `tallyAndAdvance` finalizes the round. Don't re-add `select_winner`.
7. **Socket handlers re-fetch room after state-machine calls** — `ctx.room` is a snapshot. After calling any state-machine function, use `store.getRoom(ctx.room.code)!` to get updated state.
8. **Timer is server-authoritative** — never compute timer values on the client. The `useRoom` hook always uses server-pushed `timer_tick` / `voting_started` values.
9. **Timer predicates are shared** — use `timerRunning` / `timerIdle` / `timerPaused` / `timerExpired` from `shared/timer-helpers.ts` on both server and client. Don't reimplement.
10. **Visibility filtering happens in `sockets/state-mapper.ts`** — don't add private fields to `PublicRoomState`. Hands are only included for the requesting player; note-giver notes only for the note giver (`myNoteGiverNotes`).
11. **`broadcastAllStates` sends per-player state** — each player gets their own `room_joined` event with their own hand. Don't broadcast raw room state to all sockets.
12. **Room codes exclude ambiguous characters** — `ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ` only (no O, 0, I, 1). No numbers.
13. **The `selectCard` function auto-draws the blind card** — there is no separate "draw blind card" event. Card selection + blind draw + movie creation happen atomically in `state-machine.ts:selectCard`.
14. **Deck operations live in `card-ops.ts`** — `shuffle`, `drawCards`, `getRefillDeck`, `drawFromDeck`, `substituteDraws` were extracted from `state-machine.ts`. Import from `card-ops.ts`, not `state-machine.ts`.
15. **Deck reshuffling is automatic** — when a deck runs out, `drawFromDeck` refills from the full card set via `getRefillDeck`. In 2-player games, franchise cards are filtered from refills too.
16. **Note giver ≠ executive** — the v2.0 redesign removed the executive entirely. `Player.isNoteGiver`, `Room.noteGiverId`, `Room.noteGiverNotes` replace the old executive fields. Don't reintroduce `isExecutive` / `executiveId` / `executiveNotes`.
17. **Note giver rotation uses `noteGiverOrder` + `noteGiverIndex`** — a random permutation generated at game start. Don't compute the next note giver by "next connected player"; read it from the order array.
18. **Total rounds is host-selected** — `Room.totalRounds` (3/5/7/10, default 5) is set in the lobby via `set_total_rounds`. Game end is `round.current >= totalRounds`, not "everyone has been note giver once".
19. **Stale-disconnect is 60s** — `STALE_DISCONNECT_MS` in `sockets/handlers.ts`. After 60s disconnected, the player is fully removed (not just marked), note giver may be reassigned, host may be promoted. Rejoin creates a fresh player if the old one was purged.
20. **Security limits are env-configurable** — `MAX_PLAYERS` and `MAX_ROOMS` can be set via environment variables. Socket/HTTP rate limits are hardcoded in `sockets/rate-limits.ts` and `index.ts`.
21. **`trust proxy` is enabled** — Express trusts one proxy hop for correct client IP identification behind nginx.
22. **VERSION is duplicated** — `shared/types.ts` has `VERSION` (2.1.0) for the client, `server/src/index.ts` has its own copy for the server (because the server can't import runtime values from the shared `.ts` file in production). Keep both in sync.
